Run PowerShell as Administrator and then execute 
> `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

Then, 

> `npm install -g pnpm`

Then, in my code directory, run 
> pnpm install

Next step is, 
> pnpm dev

This will allow me to open localhost:3000


Don't push to the main branch directly.
